ARXIV PAPERS
1. Get arxiv paper and convert to markdown
2. Get the abstract and the first section - ask LLM to summarize these.
3. Prompt is: Given the above summary, write the next section of the paper titled: <title>.
4. Repeat, but keep re-doing the previous steps, so each summary will have include more and more of the paper.

Note: Need to have a pretty good rubric fo instructing the LLM as to how it should create its summaries.

BOOK SECTION CONTINUATION
1. Get the first section.
3. Prompt is: This is an excerpt from a novel. Write the next {1 paragraphs, 2 pargraphs, etc.} of the book. Use the same style as the excerpt. Make sure that while stylistically similar, the new section moves the story forward and/or develops the characters and/or adds new information or in some way continues on meaningfully from the previous section.
4. Repeat.
