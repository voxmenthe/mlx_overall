Everything lay in his hands. He was acknowledged leader of the younger set, and his position in the Association would enable him to influence events and steer business the way of Fletcher and Kemp. Fletcher was old and he had no sons; day by day he was relinquishing control. Now that the debts were paid, more money would be free for investment. He would go into banking on his own account. The future lay with those who dealt in money, not commodities\u2026 It lay with people like himself, people who could see. Why then did he feel this desolation, which was not sickness of body, which would not be dismissed as the aftermath of debauch, coming as it did at other times and often quite unexpectedly, a feeling of being thrust without shelter under remorseless skies? The successful cannot be unhappy\u2014it was a contradiction in terms. But as he stood there, in this time of licensed introspection, with night over and duties of day not yet resumed, he fell again to rehearsing in his mind the actions he was about to take, as if seeking to give them, and with them his life as a whole, some fuller reality. Crossing the greasy cobbles, shouting for the stable-lad\u2026 Perhaps he would climb to the loft to shake him awake. His horse would be led out, snorting in the cold air. And he would turn her head south towards the river and ride through the empty streets\u2026 Suddenly he felt like a man who has played by the rules and been cheated by an opponent more cunning\u2014so cunning that it was not possible to see how the trick had been done.\n\nAt home he found his man, Hudson, already up and dressed and waiting with his usual discreet blend of deference and reproof. Hudson had been with him for almost eight years now and was licensed in various ways, but Erasmus cut him short this morning, sending him off in a hurry to make tea and get water heated for a bath.\n\nHe stayed a long time in the scented tub, Hudson labouring back and forth with buckets of warm water to pour over him. When he rose from this long immersion, he was feeling slightly languid but triumphant again. He dressed as usual with the greatest care, in a plain shirt and a suit of dark broadcloth. He was intending to spend the rest of the day at the offices of the bank, on Cheapside, where he was due to meet the owners of a shipping company in need of short-term credits. However, he had scarcely finished dressing when Hudson came to announce a visitor, a Captain John Philips, who had called without appointment.\n\n\u201cA sea-captain?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, sir. A merchant captain, by the look of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is none of that name on our books. Does he say what he wants?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, sir. When I asked him to state his business, he spoke short to me, as if he thought I should be hauling on the ropes. All he will say is that he has something of interest to impart to you.\u201d\n\nErasmus sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whose interest, his or mine? That is the question, Hudson.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you had better show him into the study.\u201d\n\nMaking his way there some minutes later, Erasmus found himself facing a thickset, weathered-looking man of middle years, in nankeen trousers and a buff-coloured top coat.\n\n\u201cI am Erasmus Kemp,\u201d he said, advancing to shake his visitor\u2019s hand. \u201cYou have some business with me, I believe. I am rather pressed this morning\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNot business, sir, not exactly business,\u201d the captain said. He hesitated for some moments, as if not sure how to proceed, though his gaze remained firmly on Erasmus. \u201cI knew your father,\u201d he said. \u201cBy repute, I mean, not personal. I am a Liverpool man, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d\u2019 Erasmus had stiffened involuntarily at this reference to his father. But the captain\u2019s blue eyes under their thick, fair brows wore a frank and friendly expression.\n\n\u201cAye, sir, and I knew Captain Thurso.\n\nOn rather closer terms\u2014too close for comfort. I sailed under Thurso once, before I got my own ship. Once was enough\u2014more than enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, excuse me, my time is short this morning. May I ask where this is leading?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Liverpool Merchant, that was her name, his last ship. There was a deal of talk at the time. There is always talk about a ship that goes down. And this was a new-built ship. I remembered it, being your father\u2019s ship and skippered by Thurso.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you are right enough, that was her name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had a figurehead on her of a big-breasted woman with flowing hair. That is right, is it not, just to be sure?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWhy, yes.\u201d Into his mind there came the memory of that distant afternoon in Oates\u2019s workshop by the Mersey, the staring figures, the smells of pitch and varnish, the irascible carver limping among his creations, his father\u2019s enthusiasm for the huge, garish duchess looming above them with her yellow hair and blue dress, her look of a captive giant.\n"
